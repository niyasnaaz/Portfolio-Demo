                <h6>Apple I</h6>
                <p>Jobs and his co-founder Steve Wozniak created the Apple I, a personal computer with no monitor, no
                    keyboard and no mouse. The original selling price when it was launched in 1976 was $666.66.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h6>Apple II</h6>
                <p>Launched in 1977, Apple II was an improved and updated version of the previous model, this time with
                    a keyboard, monitor and a new operating system.
                    Wozniak had contributed much to its design and new features which made it easier to use and
                    expandable. The Apple II was one of the first mass-produced, widely popular, and profitable personal
                    microcomputers.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h6>The Macintosh</h6>
                <p>With the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984, called Mac for short, personal computing took a
                    giant leap forward with its innovative graphics interface and mouse, an efficient, easy-to-use
                    substitute for the keyboard, although the keyboard was also part of the package.</p>

                <h6>Pixar</h6>
                <p>Ever restless and looking for new opportunities, Jobs bought an obscure computer graphics firm from
                    the director of "Star Wars," George Lucas. Branding the firm Pixar, Jobs retooled the company as an
                    animated film studio. Pixar went on to win more than 25 Academy Awards</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <h6>NeXT</h6>
                <p>launched a new firm—NeXT—producing innovative computer workstations and accompanying operating
                    systems, and power graphics. Marketed especially to students and universities, the firm was not
                    successful. Apple struggled in the absence of Jobs, bought NeXT for $429 million in 1996 and rehired
                    Jobs in 1997 as CEO.</p>

                <p>launched in 2001, was basically a computer hard drive with some functional embellishments,
                    with a set of earbuds and a control system. It enabled its users to store and playback music and
                    songs on its hard drive. The songs could be bought online at the iTunes retailer for as little as 99
                    cents.</p>

                <h6>The iPhone</h6>
                <p>Fitting snugly into the palm of your hand, the iPhone, released in 2007, could send and receive
                    telephone calls, play movies, retrieve your e-mail, surf the net, and send and receive text
                    messages. Numerous other smartphone applications were added as subsequent models were released.</p>
